## Description 

Step-1:Initially I imported the following libraries:<br>
1.Numpy<br>
2.Pandas<br>
3.Tensorflow<br>
Then the data to be utilized was pre-processed in data preprocessing step<br><br><br>

Step-2:Encoding categorical data, which implies converting categorical data into integer format so that the data with converted categorical values can be provided to the models to give and improve the predictions.<br><br><br>

Step-3:Splitting the data set into test set and training set using train_test_split from sci-kit learn.<br><br><br>

Step-4:After specifying the test set and training set, building of ANN model was done as per the following steps:<br><br>

Step-5:Once the model was built, it was trained for the selected dataset and the predictions were analysed<br>
As per the results it can be concluded that:
<b>Accuracy of the model was 0.8615<b><br>
    From the matrix we can say that:<br>
    No. of people predicted correctly (stay): 1520<br>
    No. of people predicted incorrectly (stay): 202<br>
    No. of people predicted incorrectly (not stay): 75<br>
    No. of people predicted correctly (not stay): 203<br><br><br>
